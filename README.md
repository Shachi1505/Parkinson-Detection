# Parkinson-Detection
Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement leading to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance and coordination. It ranks as the second most common neurodegenerative disease, following Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we will analyze the patientsâ€™ data who are diagnosed with the disease. Using speech data from subjects is expected to help the development of a noninvasive diagnostic. People with Parkinsonism (PWP) suffer from speech impairments like dysphonia (defective use of the voice), hypophonia (reduced volume), monotone (reduced pitch range), and dysarthria (difficulty with articulation of sounds or syllables). Therefore, our analysis in this project will be based on voice parameters of the affected. 
This study's relevance has many layers. First, by filling in a knowledge gap about the effectiveness and applicability of a variety of algorithms: SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest.
